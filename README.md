# Design-a-control-system-for-a-production-line
In this task we have a customer who wants to expand his activity, by increasing the items and sizes in the production line, and as a result he wants to distribute three categories of rifles: 1- box 30 * 30  2-box 20 * 20  3-box 10 Ã— 10 
and he wants to be distributed automatically On the production line... for that we decided to use the following:

# The sensors used: 
We will use three LDR sensors and three lighting sources directed towards the sensors. It will be distributed all horizontally according to the sizes of the boxes.

# Controller: 
We'll use Arduino Uno.

# Motors used:
We will use servo motor, it's gives us specific angles and appropriate torque

# Electronic circuit design: 
The circuit was designed using the Tinkercad simulator as shown above.

# Programming: 
It was done by means of TinkerCAD, where the if condition was used

# Operation and experiment:
The boxes will move in the production line randomly and when you pass the sensor according to their height, the lighting directed on the sensors will disappear and the servo motor will move either towards 0 degrees, or 90 degrees or 180 degrees.
